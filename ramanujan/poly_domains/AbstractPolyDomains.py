    """
    This is an abstract class, meant to represent the polynomial domains iterated through a run.

    A poly domain is defined here as two families of polynomials. Each family is defined by a function with variables,
    referred to as coefficients Each coefficient has it allowed range size.
    This class will generate all coefficients under those restrictions.

    Each decanted class must create a calculation method to use those coefficients

    Examples:
            A(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c
            B(n) = d*n^2 + e*n + f
            is classical a poly domain, where both a,b has 3 degrees of freedom, giving us 6 degrees of freedom in total.

            A(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c
            B(n) = A(n) * A(n-1)
            This combination only has 3 degrees of freedom. Also, given a,b,c
            the calculation for A and B are different. The way to calculate each
            series by given constants, is the calculation method
