"""
This scripts demonstrate an infinite family of GCFs that converges to a permutation of zeta(3).
The family consists of those series:
    an = n^3 (n+1)^3 + 2c(c+1)(2n+1)
    bn = -n^6
While c can be any rational number. To describe c as a rational number we use
    c <- c + x / y
The GCF value will be:
    -2/polygamma(2,c+x/y). 
During the calculation we inflate (multiply by constant) the GCF, and the result might be this value multiplied by a 
factor.
For integer values (x=0) polygamma is a mobius transform of zeta(3). For rational number, it is a more complex 
expression and using PSLQ with zeta(3) will not recognize it, so this script doesn't give a definite value for them.
