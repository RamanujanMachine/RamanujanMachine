# MasseyRamanujan

The Ramanujan Machine is an algorithmic approach to discover new mathematical conjectures. For the time being, the 
project is focused in number theory, specifically on finding formulas relating fundamental constants like pi, e, and 
the Riemann zeta function values to various continued fractions.

For more information, please go to [RamanujanMachine.com](https://www.RamanujanMachine.com).

## Installation

As of now, [Python3.10.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/) (and no later) is required. Clone the repo, install the package, and run
```
pip install -e .
```
under the same folder as `setup.py`. That's it, you are now ready to discover new conjectures.

## LIReC - The Database
(TODO) After you obtain your scout user, you may connect to ***LIReC*** *(Library of Integer RElations and Constants)* so you can start adding relations.
The way by which the code can add relations on its own is by using an algorithm called PSLQ to check whether certain subsets of constants from the database have an integer relation between them. This is done by calling
```
python db/lirec.py start
```
under the same folder as `setup.py` and waiting for results. You may also call `python db/lirec.py stop` at any time to stop searching (in addition to just closing the window).

### Configuring the Search
The configuration is in `db/config.py`, where there's both the login credentials and details for running "jobs" that search for relations.
By default, all cores on your CPU will be utilized to search for MÃ¶bius-like relations between a named constant and a PCF.
If you want, you may change this under `configuration['jobs_to_run']['poly_pslq']`, more details on its functionality are in that file.

### New Database
Should you need to create a new database (for local testing, for instance), first install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on the machine intended to host the database, then create a new PostgreSQL server on that machine (pgAdmin, a builtin application in PostgreSQL, can do this). Then, go to `db/config.py` and edit `db_configuration` so you can connect to your new database instead, and finally call `python db/create_db.py` to create a new database. (TODO write a better postgres installation tutorial here?)
Once you have created your own database, you may even run code from `db/su` on it (your scout user cannot run it on the main database). More information can be found in each `.py` file there.

## The MITM_RF algorithm: 
Alternatively, the MITM algorithm will "mine" new Continued Fraction conjectures of the type:
![LHS_RHS](images/LHS_RHS.png)
This project lets you control the equation space scanned by the algorithm.

### Running the code

To start a new execution, you'll need to configure three parts:
1. What LHS do you wish to scan
2. What structure does `an` and `bn` take, and what range do you wish to scan for each coefficient
3. How to decide if there was a match (precission wise) 

you can see examples under `scripts/` folder

#### Left Hand Side Hash Table (`LHSHashTable`) 
This is a data structure that holds expressions made from the required constant.
To create a LHS object, you'll need to choose a constant, and a range for all coefficients in the expression.
The values generated are saved to a file to reduce execution time.

For example, the following code will generate all Mobius transforms of `e`, with coefficients between -5 and 5.
The generated domain is saved to `e_lhs_dept5`
```python
 from ramanujan.LHSHashTable import LHSHashTable
 from ramanujan.constants import g_const_dict

 saved_hash = 'e_lhs_dept5'
 lhs_coefs_range = 5
 lhs = LHSHashTable(
    saved_hash,
    lhs_coefs_range,
    [g_const_dict['e']])
```

#### `an` and `bn` Structures (any class under `poly_domains`) 
An objects that generates pairs of `an` and `bn` series.

The simplest structure you can choose will be `Xn = c0 * n^k + c1 * n^(k-1) + ... + ck` for both `an` and `bn` (with the
matching degree for each), when coefficient is independent of the rest. 

This type of domain can be defined as follows:
 ```python
  from ramanujan.poly_domains.CartesianProductPolyDomain import CartesianProductPolyDomain
  
  poly_search_domain = CartesianProductPolyDomain(
    2, [-5, 5], # an coefs
    2, [-5, 5]) # bn coefs
```
In this example, we've chosen both `an` and `bn` to be of degree 2, and the coefficients are integers that range from
-5 to 5. All combination of coefficients under those restriction will be generated.

To create more intricate structures, you may create a class that extents `CartesianProductPolyDomain` or 
`AbstractPolyDomains`. You can take a look at `ExampleDomain` or `Zeta3Domain1` as an example that expand this logic.

#### The Enumerator (any class under `enumerators`)
Last but not least, you'll need to choose an algorithm that compares the two. 

The simplest, and fastest approach is implemented under `EfficentGCFEnumerator`. It follows a two-step process:
1. For any pair `an` and `bn` calculate the GCF to a dept of 30. Compare each result to values in LHSHashTable, using 
   low precision and store matches.
2. The matches are re-evaluated to a dept of 1000, and compared again for higher precision, thus eliminating false 
   positives. The final results are then presented as new conjectures.
   
For further information regarding this algorithm, please refer to our paper 'the Ramanujan machine' under 
the 'MITM-RF algorithm' chapter, or visit our website [RamanujanMachine.com](https://www.RamanujanMachine.com).

For example, creating `EfficientGCFEnumerator` using the `LHSHashTable` and `poly_domain` defined above:
```python
from ramanujan.enumerators.EfficientGCFEnumerator import EfficientGCFEnumerator

enumerator = EfficientGCFEnumerator(
    lhs,
    poly_search_domain,
    [g_const_dict['e']]
    )
```

And thats it! start your execution by running:
```python
results = enumerator.full_execution()
```
and print your results by running:
```python
enumerator.print_results(results)
```

### Cool examples
Examples for conjectures can be found under `scripts/paper_results`. Just run every script there and start finding
conjectures!

### Tweaking the search parameters

Now that you've seen how to run the basic code, you can tweak the search parameters and find new conjectures of your own.

If you wish to change the searched series, you can create a new class that extends `CartesianProductPolyDomain`,
and defines your new polynomial families. Please see `poly_domains\ExampleDomain` for a detailed example.
